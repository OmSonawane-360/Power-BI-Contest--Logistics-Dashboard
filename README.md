# 📦 Logistics OTIF Analysis Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **On-Time In-Full (OTIF) Analysis**, a key metric in the **logistics & supply chain industry**. OTIF measures a supplier’s ability to deliver products **within the prescribed delivery window and at full quantities ordered**.  

Using **Power BI**, I designed an interactive dashboard that provides **insights into logistics performance, delivery status, KPIs, and key influencers**.

2. ⏳ How does **OTIF performance trend over time**?  
3. 🚚 What is the **order delivery status** over time?  
4. 🏆 Which are the **highest OTIF performances** (salesperson, city, customer)?  
5. 🔎 Can we use **Key Influencers & advanced visualizations** to discover hidden insights?
